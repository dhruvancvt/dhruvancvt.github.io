                <h2>Motion Tracking using Arduino and the MPU6050 sensor </h2>
                <p>Implemented a movement tracker using the MPU6050 9-axis Inertial sensor on an Arduino. Transferred data
                    using the I2C interface and then modified the accelerometer data using Python to generate velocity and displacement through
                    successive integration. </p>

                <h2>Network Traffic Analysis and Threat Detection using a Self Built ML Model</h2>
                <p>This project focuses on analyzing network traffic data captured in PCAP (Packet Capture) files to identify potential malicious activities. 
                By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to detect attacker IPs within the network traffic dataset.</p>

                <h2>Portable Executable (PE) Injection Using Python</h2>
                <p>This project showcases a proof-of-concept implementation of Portable Executable (PE) injection using Python and the ctypes library. 
                    The code demonstrates fundamental techniques involved in process injection: 
                    including memory allocation, relocation table parsing, and remote thread creation in a Windows environment.

                <h2>Cryptocurrency Price Analysis and Prediction</h2>
                <p>This project retrieves and analyzes historical cryptocurrency data using the CoinGecko API, storing price, market capitalization, and volume trends in a structured format. 
                    Machine learning models such as ARIMA and LSTMs are used to identify patterns, forecast price movements, and analyze market volatility. 
                    This project showcases expertise in data processing, time series analysis, and predictive modeling for financial markets.
